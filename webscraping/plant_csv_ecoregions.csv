0,Ecoregion 1 â€“ East Texas Pineywoods,"The Pineywoods is graced  by 35 to 60 inches of rain  per year supporting not  only the pines â€“ loblolly,  shortleaf and longleaf mainly â€“ but  also a myriad of woodland  specialties like sphagnum  mosses, ferns, pitcher plants,  sundews, pipeworts, and  orchids. Streamside stands  of beech, oaks, elm, and  magnolia also benefit from  the heavy rainfall.East Texas boasts a rich  diversity of wildlife. Fifteen  species of Texas breeding  birds, including the Pine  Warbler, Brown-headed Nuthatch  and Red-cockaded Woodpecker  nest in this region. Bachmanâ€™s  Sparrow nests in the longleaf  pine uplands, while wintering  Bald Eagles roost in undisturbed  uplands near rivers and  lakes.

1,"Ecoregion 2 â€“ Gulf  Coast Prairies and Marshes ","A narrow band about 60  miles wide along the Texas  coast from the Louisiana  border to Brownsville roughly  outlines the Gulf Coast  Prairies and Marshes. This  area is characterized by  long and continual confrontations  with the sea, wind and rain.  These confrontations shape  this place creating a tapestry  of shallow bays, estuaries,  salt marshes, dunes and  tidal flats. Because of  this proximity to the Gulf  of Mexico, the plants of  this region must be highly  salt tolerant or halophytic. Coastal areas are rich  in wildlife. Coastal marshes  harbor hundreds of thousands  of wintering geese and ducks  and provide critical landfall  in the spring for neotropical  migratory birds. Several  important wildlife sanctuaries  and refuges are located  in this region including  refuges for the endangered  Attwaterâ€™s Prairie-chicken  and the Whooping Crane.  Coastal dunes may serve  as sentry roosts for north  bound Peregrine Falcons  in the fall. Coastal waters  are often graced by willets,  sanderlings, gulls, terns  and Black Skimmers.

2,"Ecoregion 3 â€“ Post  Oak Savannah ","Immediately west of the  East Texas Piney Woods we  find the Post Oak Savannah  emerging almost imperceptibly  with its subtle changes  in soil and vegetation.  This approximately 8,500,000  acres of gently rolling  to hilly land receives an  annual rainfall of 35 to  45 inches per year. While  much of this area is somewhat  arid due to the clay pan  soils, a notable exception  occurs in Bastrop County,  the home of the Lost Pines.  The Carrizo sands here harbor  a unique community of loblolly  pine, post oak, and blackjack  oak. The Post Oak Savannah is  punctuated by scattered  oaks â€“ mainly post  oaks and blackjack oaks.  Black hickory may also be  locally abundant. Cedar  elm, sugarberry, eastern  red cedar and common persimmon  are also widespread. Historically,  wide vistas of tall-grass â€“ little  bluestem, Indiangrass, switchgrass  and a myriad of wildflowers  were broken only by the  occasional motte of trees  giving the landscape a park  like atmosphere. Peat bogs  mingled amongst stands of  flowering dogwood, sassafras,  brumelia and yaupon are  also found here.This transitional area  between woodlands and prairies  was especially attractive  to the early European settlers.  Today the region is mostly  improved pasture with vast  acreages seeded to Bahia  Grass and Bermuda Grass.The distinctive sandy inclusion  of the Lost Pines area harbors  one of the last refuges  for the endangered Houston  Toad.","[' Wooly birch', ' Pecan', ' Black hickory', ' Sugarberry', ' Black walnut', ' Southern red oak', ' Bur oak', ' Blackjack oak', ' Chinkapin oak', ' Post oak', ' American elm', ' Cedar elm', ' Texas persimmon', ' Wax myrtle', ' Honey mesquite', ' Drumond red maple', ' Eastern redbud', ' Flowering dogwood', ' Mexican plum', ' Ashe juniper', ' Loblolly pine']","[' American beautyberry', ' Buttonbush', ' Black dalea', ' Lantana', ' Texas honeysuckle', ' Autumn sage', ' Sassafras', ' Coral-berry']","[' Prickly-pear cactus', ' Narrow-leaf yucca', ' Thread-leaf yucca']","[' Wooly pipevine', ' Cross-vine', ' Trumpet-creeper', ' Old manâ€™s\r\n        beard', ' Coral honeysuckle', ' Virginia creeper', ' May-pop', ' Yellow passionvine', ' Prairie rose', ' Mustang grape']",,,"[' Big blue stem', ' Broomsedge', ' Sideoats grama', ' Cane bluestem', ' Buffalograss', ' Inland sea-oats', ' Hooded windmillgrass', ' Canada wildrye', ' Big muhly', ' Little bluestem', ' Indiangrass']","[' Butterfly-weed', ' Winecup', ' Prairie larkspur', ' Coralbean', ' Late boneset', ' Maximillian sunflower', ' Cardinal flower', ' Turkâ€™s cap', ' Scarlet sage', ' Indian paintbrush', ' Texas bluebells', ' Texas bluebonnet']", eco_postoaksavanah.jpg
3,"Ecoregion 4 â€“ The  Blackland Prairies ","The fertile dark clay soils  of the Blackland Prairies  are some of the richest  soils in the world. They  are found in gently rolling  to nearly level regions  just west of and, in some  cases, surrounded by the  Post Oak Savannah of ecoregion  3. Pecan, cedar elm, various  oaks and hackberry dot the  landscape with some mesquite  invading the southern reaches.  The dominant grass of this  true tall grass prairie  is little bluestem, but  big blue stem, Indiangrass,  eastern gammagrass, switchgrass  and side oats grama can  also be found. Annual rainfalls  of 30 to 40 inches and temperatures  of 66 to 70 degrees are  average for this region. Today, this region is almost  entirely under the plow,  with only 5000 of the original  12 million acres remaining  in true prairie condition.  This region truly represents  some of the rarest landscapes  in Texas!Like many prairie communities  comprising the Great Plains  of North America, the Blackland  Prairies harbor few rare  plants or animals, though  the prairie itself is significantly  in decline. The special  and unique feature of this  ecosystem today are the  grasslands communities themselves.People are often surprised  to learn that trees comprised  a part of the prairie ecosystems,  but several tree species,  including some of significant  sizes, will show in this  list.","[' Pecan', ' Black Walnut', ' Sycamore', ' Eastern Cottonwood', ' Burr Oak', ' Shumard Red Oak', ' American Elm', ' Cedar Elm', ' Common Persimmon', ' Deciduous Holly', ' Red Mulberry', ' Carolina Buckthorn', ' Huisache', ' Red Buckeye', ' Eastern Redbud', ' Mexican Plum', ' American Elderberry', ' Eastern Red Cedar']","[' American Beauty-berry', ' Buttonbush', ' Fragrant Sumac', ' Autumn Sage']",[' Pale-leaf Yucca'],"[' Cross-vine', ' Trumpet Creeper', ' Coral Honeysuckle', ' Virginia Creeper', ' May Pop', ' Prairie Rose      ']",,,"[' Big Bluestem', ' Sideoats grama', ' Canada Wildrye', ' Big Muhly', ' Indiangrass', ' Little Bluestem']","[' Columbine', ' Purple Coneflower', ' Coralbean', ' Cardinal Flower', ' Turkâ€™s Cap', ' Scarlet Sage', ' Indian Paintbrush', ' Texas Bluebonnet', ' Brown-eyed Susan      ']", eco_blacklandprairie.jpg
4,"Ecoregion 5 â€“ The  Cross Timbers and Prairies ","About 17 million acres  are represented by this  region of alternating bands  of wooded habitat scattered  throughout a mostly prairie  region. Rainfall is highly  variable in this region,  averaging about 25 inches  in the western reaches to  35 inches in the east. Temperatures  average about 67 degrees.  Grassland species such as  little bluestem, Indiangrass  and big bluestem are common.  Texas mulberry, American  elm and Osage orange are  more common here than they  were to the east. In the  west, live oak becomes more  important, replacing the  post oak of the east. Decreasing  moisture discourages clusters  of trees, and trees form  isolated stands. Flameleaf  sumac, redbud, Mexican plum  and Eastern red cedar become  more prevalent. Wildlife  is a mixture of eastern  forest and prairie species.","[' Pecan', ' Black Walnut', ' Sycamore', ' Eastern Cottonwood', ' Plateau Liveoak', ' Bur Oak', ' Blackjack Oak', ' American Elm', ' Texas Persimmon', ' Little Walnut', ' Honey Mesquite', ' Lance-leaf Sumac', ' Mexican Plum', ' Ashe Juniper', ' Eastern Red Cedar']","[' American Beauty-berry', ' Buttonbush', ' Lantana', ' Fragrant Sumac', ' Autumn Sage', 'Succulent', ' Red Yucca', ' Threadleaf Yucca']",,,"[' Trumpet-creeper', ' Coral Honeysuckle', ' Snapdragon Vine', ' Virginia Creeper', ' Yellow Passionvine']",,"[' Big Bluestem', ' Sideoats Grama', ' Buffalograss', ' Big Muhly', ' Little Bluestem', ' Eastern Gammagrass']","[' Coralbean', ' Engelmann Daisy', ' Late Boneset']", eco_crosstimbers.png
5,"Ecoregion 6 â€“ South  Texas Brush Country ","East of the Rio Grande  River and south of the Balcones  Escarpment lies a relatively  unpopulated region known  as the South Texas Brush  Country. An average annual  temperature of 73 degrees  and rainfall ranging from  16 inches in the west to  30 inches in the east characterize  the region. This warm region  is a land of recurring drought,  a factor that distinctly  marks the landscape. Sporadic  rains can cause wildflower  blooms almost anytime of  the year.This region owes its diversity  to converging elements of  the Chihuahuan Desert to  the west, the Tamaulipan  thornscrub and subtropical  woodlands along the Rio  Grande and the coastal grasslands  to the east. The region  is cut by arroyos and streams  and is blanketed with low-growing  mostly thorny vegetation.  Where conditions allow,  a dense understory of small  trees and shrubs will develop.  The distinctive woody vegetation  gives rise to the name â€œbrush  countryâ€ù.The only subtropical area  in Texas is the distinctive  Rio Grande Valley Region  of the South Texas Plains.  Comprising Cameron, Willacy,  Hidalgo and Starr counties,  it once supported majestic  groves of Texas Palmetto,  Montezuma cypress and ebony-anaqua  woodlands. Today, most of  the region has been bulldozed,  plowed or otherwise fallen  victim to urbanization.  The once extensive groves  of Sabal palm that once  flourished here are now  reduced to a few stands  in or near Brownsville. The extensive history of  land use in the Rio Grande  Plain has not prevented  the area from harboring  many rare species of both  animal and plant. It is  here that we can find a  few remaining wild tropical  cats like ocelots and jaguarundis.  Ferruginous Pygmy-owl, Green  jay, Elf Owl, Texas totoise,  Indigo snake and Mexican  burrowing toad are also  found in this region. Rare  plants, especially in the  cactus family like Albertâ€™s  black lace cactus, star  cactus and Runyons cory  cactus are among a surprising  number of plants that occur  in the region.","[' Pecan', ' Sugarberry', ' Brasil', ' Anaqua', ' Great Leadtree', ' Texas ebony', ' Plateau liveoak', ' Sabal palm', ' Black willow', ' Coma', ' Texas persimmon', ' Texas kidneywood', ' Honey mesquite', ' Lotebush', ' Huisache', ' Desert willow', ' Texas wild olive']","[' Fiddlewood', ' Desert yaupon', ' Rio Grande abutilon', ' Bee bush', ' Agarita', ' American Beauty-berry', ' Chile pequin', ' Lantana', ' Cenizo', ' Barbados cherry', ' Turkâ€™s cap', ' Rose pavonia', ' Autumn sage']","[' Agave', ' Huaco', ' Yucca']","[' Marshâ€™s pipevine', ' Old manâ€™s\r\n        beard', ' Coral honeysuckle']",,"[' Ashe juniper', ' Montezuma bald\r\n        cypress']","[' Sideoats grama', ' Slender grama', ' Buffalograss', ' Inland sea-oats', ' Plains lovegrass', ' Little bluestem ']","[' Lila de los llanos', ' Englemann daisy', ' Heartleaf hibiscus', ' Scarlet sage', ' Red prickly poppy', ' Red gaillardia', ' Purple phacelia']", eco_southplains.png
6,"Ecoregion 7 â€“ Edwards  Plateau ","Nearly 24 million acres  dominated by Ashe juniper,  oaks and honey mesquite  comprise the beautifully  rugged, semi arid region  of the Edwards Plateau in  central Texas. Much of the  region overlays the immense  underground reservoir of  the Edwards Aquifer which  feeds many crystal clear  streams. Avearge annual  rainfall ranges from a meager  15 inches in the west to  more than 33 inches in the  east. Droughts can be frequent,  prolonged and unpredictable  though. More than 100 of Texas  400 endemic plants, including  Texas snowbells, Bracted  twist-flower, Texabama croton  and Texas wildrice occur  within the Edwards Plateau  ecoregion. In protected  valleys one might find disjunct  populations of Texas madrone,  Texas smoke tree, witch  hazel and big-tooth maples.  The moist river corridors  are lined with bald cypress,  pecan, hackberry and sycamores.  This region is also host  to some of the most spectacular  wildflower displays featuring  bluebonnets, Indian paintbrush,  gaillardia and golden-wave  among others.Among the terrestrial vertebrates,  the white-tailed deer shares  his domain with such varied  fauna as armadillo, black-tailed  jackrabbit, opossum and  the Texas earless lizard.  The waters host an array  of wildlife including Clear  Creek gambusia, San Marcos  gambusia, fountain darter  and San Marcos salamander.  Guadalupe bass and Cagleâ€™s  Map Turtle are at home in  the rivers and the thousands  of caves harbor shrimp,  blind salamanders and bats. This region is a meeting  ground for birds typical  of eastern and western North  America. Green Kingfisher,  Cave Swallow, Black-capped  Vireo and Golden-cheeked  Warbler are among the many  nesting birds of the region.

7,"Ecoregion 8 â€“ Rolling  Plains ","At the south end of the  Great Plains of the central  United States, this region  characterizes the â€œlast  gaspâ€ù or the great  continental prairie ecosystem.  Annual rainfall in the region  averages 22 to 30 inches,  with the greater numbers  being in the east. Average  temperatures are 60 to 64  degrees. East of the Cap  Rock, the native prairies  consist of midgrass to tallgrass  communities. Pristine pockets  of prairie are a rare treat  today though. Much of the  great expanse of sideoats  grama, little bluestem and  blue grama is now tilled  for cotton. Overgrazing  has allowed honey mesquite  and shinnery oak to invade  the prairie â€“ along  with snakeweed and prickly  pear. Many are surprised  to learn that some trees  were a natural part of this  landscape â€“ especially  along the waterways. Plains  cottonwood, Mohr oak, netleaf  hackberry, one-seed juniper  and Rocky Mountain juniper  are among these species.The gently rolling hills  and broad flats of the Rolling  Plains harbor the headwaters  of the great rivers of Texas,  including the Canadian,  the Colorado, the Concho  and the Red Rivers which  originate in the brakes  of the Cap Rock Escarpment.  These rivers and their tributaries  are inhabited by some of  the rare and unique fauna  of Texas such as the Concho  Water Snake and the Brazos  Water Snake. Sand bars on  the upper reaches of these  rivers provide nesting habitat  for the Interior Least Tern  and the Snowy Plover. The  Palo Duro Mouse, a close  relative of the Pinyon Mouse  of the Rocky Mountains,  can be found in the juniper  woodlands on the steep breaks  of the canyons there.

8,"Ecoregion 9 â€“ High  Plains ","Extending from the Panhandle  south to the Pecos River,  the High Plains have been  described as a sea of waving  grasslands. The 20 million  acres of this region fills  most of the â€œhandle  portionâ€ù of the state.  It is a relatively high  and level plateau of sandy  to heavy, dark calcareous  clay soils over an impervious  layer of caliche. The winters  here are the coldest in  Texas, with the average  annual temperature being  only 59 degrees. Rainfall  ranges from 21 inches in  the east to about 12 inches  in the west. Sun and wind  rob the soil of even the  meager water it receives  from these rainfalls. Today,  most of the High Plains  is irrigated by the vast  Ogallala formation.Classified as mixed plain  and short-grass prairie,  vegetation in the High Plains  varies â€“ highly dependent  on location. Hardlands or  mixed lands, sandy lands  or caliche lakes, all give  rise to a very different  plant community. Honey mesquite  and yucca have invaded some  areas that were characteristically  free of trees and brush.  Sand sage and shinnery oak  have spread through most  of the sandy lands. Playa lakes play an essential  role in this region, and  they are the prime waterfowl  wintering grounds for the  North American Central Flyway. The regions other name, â€œLlano  Estacadoâ€ù or â€œStaked  Plainsâ€ù is believed  to refer to the first European  settlers who drove stakes  into the ground to help  guide them across this featureless  region. These early pioneers  found a vast carpet of short  grasses that were home to  enormous herds of buffalo  and pronghorn antelope.  This was also the home of  the Comanches. The original character  of the High Plains has been  forever changed by the plow,  however unique areas still  remain including some scattered  sand dunes cloaked with  Harvard shin-oak, sandsage,  and little bluestem. Tallgrass  meadows can still be found  waving in the breezes along  the Canadian and Red Rivers.  While few rivers actually  cross the High Plains, these  meager water sources along  the Canadian and Red Rivers  one sustained luxuriant  growths of tall willows  and cottonwoods. Russian  olive and tamarisk, two  introduced species from  the Old World, now replace  these native trees along  the rivers, altering the  natural habitat of kingbirds  and phoebes. Grasses still  provide cover and nesting  habitats for myriads of  other birds, and belts of  trees planted in the 1930s  provide shelter to an amazing  diversity of wildlife. While  the Gray Wolf and elk no  longer occur on the High  Plains, mountain lions,  coyote, Red-tailed Hawk  and swift fox now crown  the food chain. While greatly  reduced, scattered populations  of Lesser Prairie-chicken  still boom to announce the  coming of spring across  the region while flocks  of Lark Buntings and Horned  Larks ply the skies over  this restless sea of grass.","[' Plains cottonwood', ' Honey mesquite', ' Bur oak', ' Western soapberry', ' Net-leaf hackberry', ' Silver-leaf mountain\r\n          mahogany', ' Mohr oak', ' Lance-leaf\r\n          sumac', ' Texas redbud', ' Prairie crabapple']","[' Oklahoma plum', ' Common choke-cherry', ' Sand sage', ' Fourwing saltbush', ' Silver agarita', ' Feather dalea', ' Winter fat', ' Harvard shin-oak', ' Little-leaf sumac']","[' Teddy-bear cholla', ' Narrow-leaf yucca', ' Plains yucca']","[' Old manâ€™s\r\n        beard', ' Snapdragon vine', ' Vine milkweed', ' Canyon grape']",,"[' Rocky mountain\r\n        juniper', ' Eastern red cedar', ' Colorado pinyon\r\n        pine']","[' Western wheatgrass', ' Cane bluestem', ' Sideoats grama', ' Blue grama', ' Buffalograss', ' Ear muhly', ' New Mexico little\r\n        bluestem']","[' Winecup', ' Purple coneflower', ' Englemann daisy', ' Blackfoot daisy', ' Missouri evening\r\n        primrose', ' Pink plains penstemon', ' Mealy sage', ' Copper-mallow', ' Indian blanket', ' Texas bluebonnet', ' Tahoka daisy', ' Prairie verbena']",eco_highplains.png
9,"Ecoregion 10 â€“ The  Trans-Pecos ","Perhaps the most spectacular  ecoregion in Texas is the  Trans-Pecos, offering both  breathtaking landscapes  and incredibly biodiversity.  West of the Pecos River  this 19 million acres of  impressive desert grassland,  desert scrub, salt basins,  sand hills, and rugged plateaus  to wooded mountain slopes  support an amazing variety  of plant and animal life  that is highlighted by the  amazing diversity within  the coniferous and mixed  hardwood forests at the  mountain peaks. More rare  and endemic species can  be found in this region  than in any other part of  Texas. Parts of this region are  the hottest and driest of  the state, with some areas  receiving less than 8 inches  of annual rainfall. Precipitation  tends to rise with elevation,  so the more moisture loving  plant communities are likely  to be in the mountains.  Heat is a significant feature  of the area, and the average  temperature of 64 degrees  fails to reflect either  extreme.The south rim of a mountain  system here might include  juniper, Texas madrone and  pine species, while the  desert immediately surrounding  it might feature creosote  bush and ocotillo. Creosote-tarbush  desert-scrub grasslands  are the dominant features  interspersed with montane  forests of pinyon pine,  ponderosa pine and oak. Fifty four species of bird  are primarily confined to  this region within the state  including the prized Montezumaâ€™s  Quail. This is the region  where the Lucifer Hummingbird  is most reliably seen. Berylline  Hummingbird has only been  reported from the Trans-Pecos.  Reptiles abound including  eastern collared lizard  and Trans-Pecos rat snake.  Mexican long-tongued bat,  Texas antelope squirrel  kit fox and bighorn sheep  are some of the unusual  mammals found in this area.  Black bears and mountain  lions are both making significant  returns in this area.
